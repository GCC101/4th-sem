Write a Java program that implements a multi-thread application that has three threads. First thread 
generates a random integer for every 1 second; second thread computes the square of the number and 
prints; third thread will print the value of cube of the number.
import java.util.Random;
//using Thread Class
class prg3b{
static int randomInteger;
public static void main(String[] args){
System.out.println("For 10 Random numbers");
MyThread1 thread1 = new MyThread1();
thread1.start();//start thread1
}
}
//Thread1
class MyThread1 extends Thread{
public void run() {
int i = 0;
try {
//generating 10 random numbers
while(i<10) {
Random random = new Random();
prg3b.randomInteger = random.nextInt(10);
System.out.println((i+1)+" Random integer is "+prg3b.randomInteger);
new MyThread2().start();//start thread2
new MyThread3().start();//start thread3
Thread.sleep(1000*1);//delay for display of output
System.out.println("\n");
i++;
}
}
catch (InterruptedException exception) {
exception.printStackTrace();
}
}
}
//Thread2
class MyThread2 extends Thread {
public void run() {
System.out.println("Square of "+prg3b.randomInteger + " is " +prg3b.randomInteger * prg3b.randomInteger );
}
}
//Thread3
class MyThread3 extends Thread {
public void run() {
System.out.println("Cube of "+prg3b.randomInteger + " is " + prg3b.randomInteger * prg3b.randomInteger * 
prg3b.randomInteger );
}
}
For 10 Random numbers
1 Random integer is 5
Cube of 5 is 125
Square of 5 is 25
2 Random integer is 7
Cube of 7 is 343
Square of 7 is 49
3 Random integer is 1
Square of 1 is 1
Cube of 1 is 1
4 Random integer is 9
Square of 9 is 81
Cube of 9 is 729
5 Random integer is 3
Cube of 3 is 27
Square of 3 is 9
6 Random integer is 3
Square of 3 is 9
Cube of 3 is 27
7 Random integer is 9
Square of 9 is 81
Cube of 9 is 729
8 Random integer is 7
Square of 7 is 49
Cube of 7 is 343
9 Random integer is 6
Cube of 6 is 216
Square of 6 is 36
10 Random integer is 2
Square of 2 is
